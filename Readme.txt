Welcome to the useless toolbox

First, most Linux runs a terminal and write the 'git clone https://github.com/LunaFlies/Luna-s-useless-but-fun-tools command'
I don't know the rest

In any case, enhanced operating systems such as Ubuntu have built-in tools
There are only similar tools, so I don't use them often
Still, I put him in my Easter in the script sometimes, so look where he is lol

And for the git/decode.meow file, change the extension to .txt and open it

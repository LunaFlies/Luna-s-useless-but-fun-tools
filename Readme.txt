Welcome to the useless toolbox

First, most Linux runs a terminal and write the 'git clone https://github.com/LunaFlies/Luna-s-useless-but-fun-tools command /home/(username)/'
I don't know the rest

And enter the 'chmod +x git/access.sh' command
Running chmod +x git/Access.sh will allow you to run all scripts

In any case, enhanced operating systems such as Ubuntu have built-in tools
There are only similar tools, so I don't use them often
Still, I put him in my Easter in the script sometimes, so look where he is lol

And for the git/decode.meow file, change the extension to .txt and open it

And I'll select and copy the entire contents
Go to https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image
Paste it in the base64 box and press the Decode Base64 to Image button to get the image
